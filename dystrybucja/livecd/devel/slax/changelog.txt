6.1.2

- upgraded Slax kernel to 2.6.27.27, which contains many bugfixes
- added xz package (LZMA compressor/decompressor)
- added support for txz Slackware packages
- upgraded midnight commander to understand txz packages
- fixed incorrect reporting of module file path in Slax Module Manager
  (if size of module was smaller than 1MB, it didn't show module file at all)
- fixed incorrect slaxsave.dat (the 1GB one), thanks to forum user att
- added 2GB slaxsave.dat file to the zip archive
- added FireFox 3.5.1, as a separated module 007-firefox.lzm
  This version integrates itself into KDE
- added Slax Drive support, see www.slax.org/slax-tools.php for more info



6.1.1

- fixed handling of SATA devices by compiling IDE_GENERIC driver as a module
  instead putting it inside the kernel directly
- added support for some ATHEROS and IWLWIFI devices
- ocfs is now compiled as a kernel module since I was told it's better that way
- upgraded Flash Player plugin to version 9.0.159


6.1.0

- no more new features will be added to Slax 6.x, only bugfixes
- added fake XDM to 002-xorg, so it will start fluxbox if KDE is not present
- upgraded to Slackware-current as of the last changes before KDE4 were in
- added new wallpaper
- fixed a lot of fluxbox-related bugs, now even fluxbox can select accurate
  (preferred) screen resolution and play a startup sound


6.0.9

- upgraded to Slackware-12.2
- upgraded to Linux Kernel 2.6.27.8
- upgraded samba-stripped, added libcap
- fixed a bug in unsquashfs (lzm2dir) which happened on SMP machines
- removed bluez* packagess


6.0.8

- upgraded to Linux Kernel 2.6.27.6
- upgraded to KDE 3.5.10
- upgraded to Slackware-current
- upgraded to squashfs 3.4 including the tools (Thanks to Petr Vokac!)
- added support to start Slax as a PXE server (in the boot menu)
- loadlin didn't work anymore due to big filesize of vmlinuz and initrd.
  It has been replaced by linLd, which allows us to boot Slax from DOS again
- autodetect and automount LVM partitions. Suppress by 'noauto' boot parameter
- cleanum /union/mnt/ directory (delete all empty directories every boot)
- if 'ip=' boot parameter is present, initialize network drivers, request
  the IP address from DHCP server and mount live data over HTTP from the server
  provided as a second argument to the ip= boot param (separated by semicolon)
  Usually, the ip= parameter is auto-added by pxelinux, and it looks like:
  ip=<client-ip>:<boot-server-ip>:<gw-ip>:<netmask>
- udev-fstab-update: added mutex lock to make sure only one instance
  of the script runs at the same time (udev starts them in parallel).
  A forum user 'specialist' thinks that parallel execution may break fstab
- Archives for static linking (*.a) moved to devel module
- implemented a posixovl workaround, which executes 'find' on the directory
  with changes. This may slow down the boot a bit, but it seems to be enough
  in order to make sure the posixovl filesystem behaves correctly all the time.
  It initiates correct caches and doesn't make aufs confused anymore.


6.0.7

- Slax and all its parts are now Upgraded to Slackware 12.1
- some enhancements to activate script to autostart correct startup scripts
- better GTK integration - using KDE icons is prefered
- when a module is already activated and activate is called again, show Yes/No dialog allowing to deactivate



6.0.6

- updated Flash Player to the latest version
- recompiled KDE to fix some older FLAC dependencies
- added libidl


6.0.5

- fixed alsa mixer settings when booting Slax on several different computers
  with changes enabled
- some slik:// fixes. Two things were needed - httpfs was modified to stop
  refusing O_RWRO in the open() call, and also losetup is now monitored 
  in linux live scripts and if error is returned, losetup -r is tried
  afterwards. Note, losetup -r is available in Slackware since util-linux-ng
  were added.
- upgraded to Slackware current again, which fixes some bugs in glibc.
- reordered the installed Slackware packages to prevent some gtk+2 problems


6.0.4

- stripped the 'samba-stripped' package even more, while adding smbspool
  and upgrading to the newest version, this should enable printing on
  shared Windows printers
- recompiled kernel against new gcc
- several packages moved from 003-desktop to 002-xorg:
  rdesktop, librsvg, libgsf, xaw3d, lm_sensors, fluxbox
- kommander (kmdr-executor) moved from 004-kdeapps to 003-desktop
- nopcmcia boot parameter fixes again (for the third time!)
- updated to Slackware-current

- make_iso.sh now works even if called from a different directory


6.0.2

- make activate and deactivate work even without k{activate/deactivate}
- Slackware's gtk+2 update fixes the buggy flash in konqueror. So the plugin
  is now enabled by default again.
- microphone audio channels are not unmuted by default, this bug has been
  introduced in 6.0.1, sorry for that
- module manager and network-config chmoded to be executable, introduced in
  6.0.1 as well, caused KDE to show annoying dialog.
- hopefully fixed the nopcmcia boot parameter



6.0.1

- bugfix: Module Manager will display correct info about slik'ed modules
- bugfix: activate refused to insert a module which was activater last time (before reboot)
          because of some empty mountpoints left. This is now fixed
- bugfix: /etc/slax-version now shows correct version number
- bugfix: trash bin was not empty
- bugfix: swap partitions were not auto activated due to a bug in linux live scripts
- bugfix: raise sound volume for 'front', 'center' and 'side' channels too
- kdeglobals set to force konqueror to follow slik:// addresses without asking
- For a popular demand for at least a stripped version of vi in Slax, symlinked vi from busybox.
  Slax will not have vi as default, but the 'vi' command will call the busybox's vi.
- workaround: because Flash plugin with konqueror hangs even after recompiling KDE 3.5.9,
  disabled flash plugins in konqueror. I have no idea how to fix that.
- added madwifi drivers version 0.9.4
- added memtest 2.1
- make posixovl less sceptic (use kernel cache and set relookup timeouts to 300 seconds)
  in order to get 2x better performace
- delete some unneeded gcc++ files to save few megabytes


6.0.0

- added new Linux Live scripts with aufs instead of unionfs
- aufs provides 100% stability and reliability. If you ever saw a kernel oops
  in Slax, this should never happen anymore thanks to unionfs replacement: aufs
- squashfs now supports LZMA compression, so Slax is a lot of smaller!
- using udev instead of hotplug to autodetect and autoload device drivers
- upgraded to newest Slackware's packages, newest Xorg, newest Kernel 2.6.24.2, newest KDE 3.5.8
- most changelog entries are missing

  to a file called slaxsave.dat, if it exists in any partition's root
  You may overide this default by your own changes=...
- added slaxsave.zip to SLAX CD. This archive contains pre-builded
  loop filesystems (size 128MB, 256MB, 512MB and 1GB). Just unpack your
  desired file to the root of some partition and SLAX will save changes to it.
  (doesn't work on NTFS as SLAX mounts NTFS readonly yet)
- added NTFS-3g beta, mount your NTFS partitions with 100% writable support!

  'changes=' and 'from='.

  the whole disk, or fromiso=/dev/sda1/slax.iso to search only on hda1
- added noauto boot argument, to disable automounting of disks

  you may load or noload all the trees by a single argument

- added make_disk.sh script to SLAX CD, to create bootable SLAX disk (eg. install SLAX to USB device)
- added different size of boot (splash) image to be more compatible with all screen resolutions
  Please note that SLAX doesn't need bootsplash patches in order to show image during boot,
  all we need is different /usr/src/linux/drivers/video/logo/logo_linux_clut224.ppm

- artsd doesn't autosuspend now, as this caused hundred of artsd processes 
  to be started on some machines (and in vmware), causing SLAX to swap or hang
