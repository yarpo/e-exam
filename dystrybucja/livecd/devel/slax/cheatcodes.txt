Cheatcodes for SLAX.
====================

Boot parameters (also known as cheatcodes) are used to affect the
booting process of SLAX. Some of them are common for all Linuxes, others
are specific for SLAX only. You can use them to disable desired kind of
hardware detection, to start SLAX from harddisk, to skip the login
prompt and start GUI, etc.
   
Reboot your computer and wait several seconds until nice  graphical slax
logo appears with a boot menu (it's there usually for less then 9 seconds).
Choose your desired menu entry and hit Tab, which will allow you to edit the
command line. Add your desired boot argument from the list below, to affect
booting the way you like:


acpi=off
nohotplug
nopcmcia
noagp

   ... disable specified hardware autodetection in the case of hangups
       Your hardware won't be detected at all, you'll have to use "pcimodules"
       command after logging into SLAX and you'll have to try to modprobe
       all needed modules from the list manually

nodma

   ... disable DMA for all CD-ROMs and disks


noauto

   ... list harddisks in fstab with 'noauto', so you have to mount every
       disk manually in order to access it.

nohd

   ... don't even know about any harddisks at all.

nocd

   ... don't even know about any cdroms at all.

nosound

   ... mute sound instead of raising volume to 77%


from=/dev/hda1/slax.iso
from=path/to/slax.iso
from=/dev/hda1
from=path/to/slax/

   ... To load SLAX data from different place instead of the boot device.
   ... First example will search for slax.iso, only on hda1
   ... Second example will search for 'path/to/slax.iso' on all devices.
       The first device containing the path/file is used
   ... Third example expects that the ISO is unpacked to hda1
   ... Fourth example searches through all disks for a directory 'path/to/slax'
       and expects content of unpacked ISO inthere


passwd=somepass
passwd=ask

   ... set root's password to "somepass", or ask (with =ask) for a new password
       during the boot, before starting slax (don't worry, the new password
       won't be shown at the login screen)


changes=/dev/device
changes=/dev/device/file.dat
changes=/path/
changes=/path/file.dat
changes=/dev/device/path/

   ... all changes you made in SLAX are kept in memory until you reboot.
       But with this boot parameter, you tell SLAX to use different device
       (or a file or directory) than the memory for storing changes. You can,
       for example, format your disk partition /dev/hda1 with some Linux
       filesystem (eg. xfs) and then use changes=/dev/hda1 to store all changes
       to that disk (it will be stored in 'changes' directory on that disk.
       This way you won't loose your changes after reboot.
   ... if you use a file name instead of device, and the file contains valid
       filesystem, Slax will mount it as a loop device and will store changes
       to it. Moreover if you don't specify the device where the file is stored,
       Slax will try to find it on all your partitions.
   ... if you use a directory, Slax will save changes to it (it will make a
       'changes' subdirectory inthere). You don't even need a Linux filesystem
       on that disk, as the directory will be overlayed by posixovl. This way,
       you can save your changes even to VFAT or NTFS.

toram
copy2ram 

   ... copy all files (all required and optional modules) to RAM.
       You'll need at least 320MB of RAM to do this and boot SLAX properly.
       This will slow down the boot phase but it will speed up SLAX!


load=module

   ... load optional modules from /optional/ directory on the CD.
       You can use full module name (module.lzm) or you can skip the extension


noload=module
noload=module[1];module[n]

   ...disable loading of any modules specified. This affects all the modules on
      SLAX CD, including /base and /modules, so using noload=kde will disable
      loading of all modules with 'kde' in the name. It is useful with copy2ram
      cheatcode, because any un-used module is not copied to ram. 


debug

   ... enable debug mode (and start bash several times during the boot)
       hit Ctrl+D to continue booting
   

autoexec=...
autoexec=startx
autoexec=xconf;startx
autoexec=xconf;startx;reboot

   ... Execute specified command(s) instead of SLAX login. In this
       example, skip slax login prompt and automatically start XWindow
       system. Use semicolon (;) as command separator.
   ... Slax will not reboot automatically after the command(s) finish,
       so if you'd like to restart, specify 'reboot' or 'poweroff' as the
       last command.
   ... If you need to use spaces in the commandline, replace them by ~.
       For example, autoexec=echo~Shutting~power;poweroff will do just like that.
